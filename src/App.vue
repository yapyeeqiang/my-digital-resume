                    Hello! My name is Yap Yee Qiang and I enjoy sharing knowledge and exploring the beauty of technology. My interest in programming started back in 2019 when I decided to try self taught myself Python, and eventually explore into the world of Web Development. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building several projects, including an E-commerce platform , a
                    logistic company dashboard, a site generation tool . My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and educate people about web development at Sigma School.
